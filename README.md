# Train-your-LLM
# Large Language Model Training

Welcome to the Large Language Model Training repository! This repository contains code and resources for training, fine-tuning, and deploying large language models using Hugging Face's Transformers library.

## About

This project aims to provide a comprehensive guide and codebase for training large language models from scratch or fine-tuning pre-trained models for specific tasks.

## Features

- Data preprocessing scripts to clean and tokenize text data.
- Model training scripts with customizable hyperparameters.
- Notebooks for interactive model exploration and experimentation.
- API for deploying trained models and generating text.

## Repository Structure

- **data/**: Contains raw and processed data used for training.
- **models/**: Stores trained model checkpoints.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for model training and evaluation.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **api/**: Flask API for deploying and serving trained models.
- **LICENSE**: License information for the repository.
- **README.md**: Main documentation file (you're reading it!).

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SreeEswran/large-language-model-training.git
    cd Train-your-LLM
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Follow the instructions in each directory to preprocess data, train models, and deploy APIs.
